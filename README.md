# Nitrogen Composition Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the nitrogen composition in a nitrogen production system based on operational variables such as air flow, pressure, and temperature. By building a regression model, the project seeks to optimize nitrogen gas production through data-driven decisions. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. Random Forest was selected as the best performing model based on R-squared and MSE metrics. The project follows a systematic data science workflow from EDA to model deployment.
